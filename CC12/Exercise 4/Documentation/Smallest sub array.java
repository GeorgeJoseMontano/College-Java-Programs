Smallest sub-Array

Given an array of integers and an integer, k, find the smallest subarray whose sum is greater than k.

Example 1:
  int theArray = { 1, 5, 20, 70, 8}
  int k  = 97

  Output:
    subarray = 20, 70, 8
    min length = 3

Example 2:
  int theArray = { 1, 10, 3, 40, 18}
  int k  = 50

  Output:
    subarray = 40, 18
    min length = 2

In your program, make theArray (the size, and the elements), and k be inputted by the user.
